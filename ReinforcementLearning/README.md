## This folder is for experiments done on Reinforcement Learning using Markov Decision Process (MDP)

The entire learning experiment is done under the supervision of **[Dr. Michael Katehakis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_N._Katehakis)**, distinguished professor at Rutgers Business School. I am grateful to learn from one of the finest teachers of my academic life!

### Codes:
All the codes are written from scratch mostly using `base` R functions and some functions from `ggplot` for visualization. Some selected contents are posted on GitHub.

* **Check the `.md`** files to see the final output of the R Markdown script (`.Rmd`) **nicely rendered on GitHub**.


### Notes:
* Learned multiple UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) policies for MAB (Multi Armed Bandit) problems and simulated their performance to compare.
    - The [Katehakis + Robbins (1995)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC41010/pdf/pnas01497-0061.pdf) policy was one of the most simple, versatile and effective policy that can be applied on various scenarios.
